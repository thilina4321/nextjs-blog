# What is Next.js

Next.js is a production-ready React.js framework that can be used for building full-stack applications.

## How it became a framework

Next.js provides numerous built-in features that help solve common problems and offer clear guidelines on how to use those features, such as a router.

## Why is it called a production-ready React.js framework?

Next.js addresses several issues commonly encountered in production-ready React.js applications. It solves these problems for you.

### Problems with React.js applications

In React.js, data is typically fetched from a component after the component has been loaded for the first time. This means that data is fetched from the client by sending a request after something is rendered on the screen. Consequently, the initial HTML page served by the server does not contain the necessary data for users. As a result, search engines cannot read the data on your web page. This becomes problematic for content-heavy applications like blogs.

## Key features and benefits of Next.js

Next.js offers several key features and benefits:

- **Built-in server-side rendering (SSR) feature:** Next.js allows you to prepare all the content of a web page on the server, rather than on the client (i.e., the browser).
- **File-based routing:** Next.js simplifies routing by using a file-based approach, reducing code and developer effort.
- **Full-stack framework:** Next.js enables the addition of backend code to Next.js applications. This means you can write code for storing data, fetching data, authentication, and more.
